<h3>Week 08</h3>
Phew, scheduling is pretty tough. All that for the best perfomance. I'd say it's worth it, though.

1. [Scheduling](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/4-Scheduling/)<br>
This source gives a good overview on scheduling. It's basically like a cheatsheet for the concepts, not too detail but just enough to explain the different types of CPU schedling.

2. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html)<br>
This source refers to the Silberschatz slides, so this is helpful to follow along the materials in class. The website is simple but, in my opinion, effective to navigate through.
