# LINKS

<h3>Week 01</h3>
This week has been interesting. I am introduced to new things such as Bash, sed, awk, grep, and much more. These links have been a great help for me to get started.

1. [Intermediate Bash Commands (grep, sed, awk, tar, less, gzip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTnihfbPCo)<br>
The speaker explains in a very understandable and beginner-friendly way. Although the video is almost an hour long, it's still a recommended source from me.


2. [Learning Awk Is Essential For Linux Users](youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok)<br>
The speaker gives a lot of examples so that the viewer may understand the concept and usage of the awk command. The content is straightforward and suitable for beginners.


3. [Learn Bash in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/)<br>
Learn X in Y minutes is a highly recommended source for me, as it gives the reader a good overview of the material they want to learn, in this case Bash. The style of teaching is through giving direct code examples and comments to explain what the code does. It's really good and you can also learn other things for Learn X in Y minutes. Check it out!


4. [Bash Guide for Beginners - The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf)<br>
From what I can understand, the PDF file gives a thorough explanation on Bash. This is recommended for those who really want to dig in to the world of Bash and enhance their understanding on Bash in general, as the structure of the documentation is ordered neatly.

5. [Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-if-else-statement/)<br>
The link points to a Bash if-else statement tutorial, but I really enjoyed learning some bits of Bash from this site in general. In my opinion, the color scheme of the site makes it easy and comfortable to read and understand the content, and also the site provides a lot of examples to understand the Bash syntax more.

6. [Learn Regex The Easy Way](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex)<br>
Learning Regex requires effort and hands-on experience. For me, this topic is interesting yet tricky, because the syntax is not so intuitive. However, this repository aims to make the learning process easier (hence the title :D). I still need to read more from this source, however. Saving this for later!

<br>

<h3>Week 02</h3>
1. [Learn C in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)<br>
Similar to last week's *Learn Bash in y minutes*, this site is a great help to get started to C programming. It explains C concepts concisely and effectively.

2. [Encryption - Symmetric Encryption vs Asymmetric Encryption - Cryptography - Practical TLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_g-M7UBqI8)<br>
This video gives a really good overview on the topic of encryption, specifically symmetric and assymmetric encryption. The speaker uses words that are easy to understand and animations that really support the explanation, making the video really digestable for beginners.

3. [Public and Private Keys - Signatures & Key Exchanges - Cryptography - Practical TLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zyKvPvh808)<br>
This video is also made by the same channel from the second link of this week. Similar in nature to that video, the speaker is able to explain seemingly daunting concepts in a surprisingly fun and enjoyable way, making me really appreciate and just "wow" in the process of using public and private keys to ensure encryption and signatures, as well as the concept of using hybrid encryption to send bulk data, benefiting from the "best of both worlds", as the speaker teaches.

4. [What's the Difference: Computer Virus vs Malware, vs Spyware, etc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvMQKffEAbk)<br>
The speaker gives a really good overview on types of malware, explaining the different types of malware in an understandable and enjoyable way.

<br>
 
<h3>Week 03</h3>
1. [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br>
This is a very solid video introducing the directories of Linux. The speaker teaches in a concise and enjoyable way, making the content suitable for Linux beginners.

2. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
Similar to the first link of this week, the speaker teaches on the topic of Linux file system. The difference is that the explanation is more thorough than the first link, benefiting the audience to enhance their knowledge on Linux file system.

3. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
The makers of this series is really able to make learning low-level computer science concepts a fun and enjoyable (yes, I am using that word too often now :)) way. This video is no exception. With amazing visuals, the speaker shows how computers store file in the hardware level with the usage of the concept of blocks and fragmentations. This stuff is pretty cool.

4. [Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws)<br>
The speaker teaches on the differences of different file system formats used in for storing files. Great video to understand more about the file system world.

5. [Unix / Linux - File Permission / Access Modes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm)<br>
This source is not about file system as the other links in this week, but it still touches the matter of files, in this case file permissions. It's a great source to know the types of permissions available in Linux, how these permissions can differ according to the role of the logged in user, and how we can manually set permissions for file and directory access. Linux is pretty cool.

<h3>Week 04</h3>
1. [Logical vs Physical Address](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics/07%3A_Memory/7.5%3A_Logical_vs_Physical_Address)<br>
This source gives a good overview on the differences of logical and physical addresses, using a simple figure and a comparison chart to explain the concepts in a friendly way.

2. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
This article helps me understand more about the concept of paging, used by operating systems to avoid external fragmentation, a problem that may occur in managing data. This source uses an example and figures to explain the topic.

3. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)<br>
The speaker presents the topic in a simple yet effective way, explaining the topic of segmented, paged, and virtual memory, contrasting how data is stored in segmented and paged memory management systems.

<br>

<h3>Week 05</h3>

1. [Your Computer is Lying To You (Virtual Memory)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw0YAUdQp1c)<br>
This video presents the concept of virtual and physical addresses in a pretty concrete way, using a C program to demonstrate how computers deal with memory management under the hood.

2. [Demand Paging and Page Replacement Algorithms](https://lass.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/courses/fall13/lectures/Lec14_notes.pdf)<br>
The source gives an in-depth explanation on demand paging and page replacement algorithms, stressing how demand paging benefits or disadvantages computer memory management, and also explaining different methods a computer may replace pages in memory.

3. [Memory: Paging](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2016su/slides/lecture11.pdf)<br>
The slide helped me in translating logical addresses to physical addresses given the contents of the logical and physical address space and the page table that maps the page to its corresponding frame.

<br>

<h3>Week 06</h3>
1. [Process vs Thread – Difference Between Them](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)<br>
This source helped me in differentiating between processes and threads, and also how threads solve problems created while using processes. The end of the story is threads are the way to go.
