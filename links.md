<h3>Week 01</h3>
This week has been interesting. I am introduced to new things such as Bash, sed, awk, grep, and much more. These links have been a great help for me to get started.

1. [Intermediate Bash Commands (grep, sed, awk, tar, less, gzip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCTnihfbPCo)<br>
The speaker explains in a very understandable and beginner-friendly way. Although the video is almost an hour long, it's still a recommended source from me.


2. [Learning Awk Is Essential For Linux Users](youtube.com/watch?v=9YOZmI-zWok)<br>
The speaker gives a lot of examples so that the viewer may understand the concept and usage of the awk command. The content is straightforward and suitable for beginners.


3. [Learn Bash in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/)<br>
Learn X in Y minutes is a highly recommended source for me, as it gives the reader a good overview of the material they want to learn, in this case Bash. The style of teaching is through giving direct code examples and comments to explain what the code does. It's really good and you can also learn other things for Learn X in Y minutes. Check it out!


4. [Bash Guide for Beginners - The Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf)<br>
From what I can understand, the PDF file gives a thorough explanation on Bash. This is recommended for those who really want to dig in to the world of Bash and enhance their understanding on Bash in general, as the structure of the documentation is ordered neatly.

5. [Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-if-else-statement/)<br>
The link points to a Bash if-else statement tutorial, but I really enjoyed learning some bits of Bash from this site in general. In my opinion, the color scheme of the site makes it easy and comfortable to read and understand the content, and also the site provides a lot of examples to understand the Bash syntax more.

6. [Learn Regex The Easy Way](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex)<br>
Learning Regex requires effort and hands-on experience. For me, this topic is interesting yet tricky, because the syntax is not so intuitive. However, this repository aims to make the learning process easier (hence the title :D). I still need to read more from this source, however. Saving this for later!
